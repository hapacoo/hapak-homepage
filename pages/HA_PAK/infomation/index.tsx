          "This is a story about invisible 'beings' within us and around us.
        </InfoP>
        <InfoP>
          Things that exist but cannot be seen, or things that do not exist but
          clearly do exist. We contemplate and visualize these things.
        </InfoP>

          The starting point of this work was my father's death. His absence,
          which began a month before I was born, has been giving me weight and
          influence as I grew up and continues to do so even now. Therefore, the
          overall question I ask in my work is how to express and concretize the
          invisible, the intangible, the momentary, and the absence.
        </InfoP>
        <InfoP>
          At first, I wanted to talk about things that are around all of us, not
          just personal things. I worked on visualizing air, which exists
          naturally but invisibly, to remind us of their existence. Spaces that
          are empty but not empty, objects that are separated but not separated.
          Things that don't touch but are touching. The invisible air was
          filling, connecting, and touching all of these.
        </InfoP>
        <InfoP>
          The invisible things were not just outside of us, or beside us. They
          were also inside us. Tiny bacteria or cells divided themselves and
          combined to become parts of the body and, on a larger scale, formed
          me. They continuously repeat the work of connecting and separating
          each other without any adhesive. Things we don't know about are
          happening inside us. They accumulate, change, and disappear without
          rest. Is this story only applicable to physical things? No.
        </InfoP>
        <InfoP>
          What things are in my inner self? What exists and constitutes me? When
          I am not 'myself', what meaning and appearance do the things I created
          as my most 'self' have?
        </InfoP>
        <InfoP>
          Dreams, which are on the boundary between consciousness and
          unconsciousness, dreams that we say we've seen but can't see with our
          eyes. I went through the process of bringing out the elements and
          questions they imply using dreams. They were the result of
          interactions between things that happened and felt in spaces that are
          real and not real. Non-verbal forms 'spoke' to me, and I translate and
          interpret them back into 'language' and 'image'."
